# AocKata

To play, go to the `lib/` folder and solve challenges in the `day*.ex` modules.

To test your solutions, run `mix test`. The example inputs have been added to the tests for your convenience.

# Competing on adventofcode.com

If you want to compete on the [Advent of Code leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard), use the code `25717-bb9d6ba6`.

Running `mix day X part Y` will also run your solutions against input files, if provided. 

You can run all of your solutions with `mix day`.

For each day, put a file named `dayX.txt` into the `priv/inputs` folder. For example, for day `10`, the file would be at `priv/inputs/day10.txt`.
